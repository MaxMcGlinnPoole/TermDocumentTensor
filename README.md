# Term Document Tensor

Creates a binary document-term tensor (matrix) populated using term freqencies and first occurences of tokenized documents for the purpose of examining bytes of data to discover malware. Uses a cosine-similarity matrix — exmplified/visualized by a heat-map — to determine strength of relationship of examined documents and/or bytes.
